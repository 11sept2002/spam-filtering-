                       Project Description*

Over recent years, as the popularity of mobile phone devices has increased, 
Short Message Service (SMS) has grown into a multi-billion dollar industry.
 At the same time, reduction in the cost of messaging services has resulted
 in growth in unsolicited commercial advertisements (spams) being sent to
 mobile phones. Due to Spam SMS, Mobile service providers suffer from some
 sort of financial problems as well as it reduces calling time for users.
 Unfortunately, if the user accesses such Spam SMS they may face the problem
 of virus or malware. When SMS arrives at mobile it will disturb mobile user
 privacy and concentration. It may lead to frustration for the user. So Spam
 SMS is one of the major issues in the wireless communication world and it
 grows day by day.

To avoid such Spam SMS people use white and black list of numbers. But this
 technique is not adequate to completely avoid Spam SMS. To tackle this problem 
it is needful to use a smarter technique which correctly identifies Spam SMS.
 Natural language processing technique is useful for Spam SMS identification.
 It analyses text content and finds patterns which are used to identify Spam 
and Non-Spam SMS.

                   Business Requirements*

A business requirement for an SMS spam classification system would include the 
ability to accurately identify and flag spam messages, protect customers from 
unwanted or harmful messages, and comply with industry regulations and laws
 regarding spam messaging. Additionally, the system should be able to handle a
 high volume of messages, integrate with existing systems and databases, and 
provide reporting and analysis capabilities to track performance and improve
the system over time. The system should also have an easy-to-use interface and 
be easy to maintain and update.

                      Literature Survey*

project would involve researching and analysing existing studies, papers, and 
articles on the topic to gain a thorough understanding of the current state of
 SMS spam classification and to identify potential areas for improvement and
 future research. The survey would include looking at different methods and
 techniques used for identifying and flagging spam messages, such as machine 
learning algorithms, natural language processing, and rule-based systems. It
 would also involve evaluating the performance and effectiveness of 
these methods, as well as their limitations and challenges. Additionally, the
 literature survey would review the current state of SMS spam and trends in the
 industry, as well as any existing laws and regulations related to spam messaging.
 The survey would also investigate the datasets and feature representations used 
in previous studies, which would help to determine the best approach for the 
current project. Furthermore, It would be important to check the pre-processing 
techniques used in the research to understand how to properly clean and prepare 
the data for the classifier.

             Social Or Business Impact*

Social Impact:- it can help protect individuals from unwanted and potentially 
harmful messages. Spam messages can include phishing attempts, scams, and fraud,
 which can have serious financial and personal consequences for recipients. By
 accurately identifying and flagging spam messages, the system can help prevent 
these types of attacks and protect individuals from falling victim to them.

Business Model/Impact:- it can help protect their customers and improve their 
reputation. Spam messages can harm a business's reputation and lead to customer 
complaints and lost business. By accurately identifying and flagging spam messages, 
the system can help protect businesses and improve their customer's trust.
